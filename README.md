# Tourist in Brasov
Alexa-Hosted skill used to travel to Brasov( a famous city in Romania).

Available in English and French.

It uses AWS( Lambda and S3).

Alexa suggests good places to visit based on the dialogue with the user( restaurants - for food, or places - for entertainement).

For restaurants, three specifications are available: international, romanian, and mediterranean( with two restaurants for each at this time).

For places, there are six names: Dracula's Castle, Aventura Park, Rope Street, Aquatic Paradise, Zoo, and Spoker Poker Club.

There is a demo available in linkForDemo file. Because it was too large, I put it in Google Drive and using a link, you have access to see it. Hope that you will be able to download and to watch it. Of course, I hope that you will find it interesting too. :D
